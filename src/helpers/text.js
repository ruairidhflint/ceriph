    paragraph1: 'Ceriph is a simple substitution cipher built with JavaScript. Substitution ciphers use a secret key to manipulate the positions of letters in the standard alphabet, allowing for a plaintext message to be transposed into ciphertext.',
    paragraph2: 'Substitution ciphers are a fun way to introduce cryptography and a quick and easy way to obscure private information between friends, however they are easily cracked by a persistent and knowledgeable code breaker. The longer the message, the higher the chance of decoding by frequency analysis.'
